### Purpose

Our Client wanted to establish a full stack web application, the web app will serve 2 main purposes. First purpose is to allow users to log and share their experiences from their travels. Second purpose is allow client to login and manage the content of the posts. 

The client wanted to establish this platform to create a niche and target a consumer base that has a strong focus on travel experiences and tips. The client realised that although there is social media applications and booking web applications that allow users to post content about where they have travelled, there was no application available that essentially combined the features of both with a focus on experiences and tips for other users. The client wanted to establish this app to allow users to be able to effectively search for unique experiences posted by others with a sole focus on travel instead of either just scrolling through all the other content of social media apps or search for destinations with no prior knowledge provided that allows them to make the most of their trip.
